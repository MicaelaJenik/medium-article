        Arguably the most naturally gifted athlete the world has ever seen, Usain St Leo Bolt, created history at the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio when he achieved the ‘Triple Triple’, three gold medals at three consecutive Olympic Games.  Usain’s journey to worldwide stardom started at the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing where he won the 100m, 200m and 4x100m, all in world record times.  He followed this up with three gold medals in the same events at the 2012 Olympic Games in London to write his name in the history books as the world’s fastest man.  Then one day before his 30th birthday he completed the same triple at the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio to cement his legacy as a legend in world sport. .</p>

        “Flesh is the reason oil paint was invented,” Willem de Kooning famously said. With explosive, gestural brushstrokes and bold colors, de Kooning’s vampish portrayals of women challenged the line between figurative and abstract painting. The six oil paintings in de Kooning’s Woman I through Woman VI series (1950–53) are among the Abstract Expressionist’s most celebrated portrayals of the female form, showcasing his revolutionary, painterly take on portraiture. While these canvases have long been off the market, collected by major museums and private collections, additional examples of de Kooning’s depictions of women include drawings, sculptures, works on paper, as well as paintings. In 2018, de Kooning’s Woman as Landscape (1954–55) broke the artist’s auction record, reaching nearly $69 million at Christie’s.</p>
